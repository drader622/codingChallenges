## Tech Used
JavaScript

## Lessons Learned
Everyday I learn that patience and attention to detail are important. I learn that it is ok to not have the solution right away, as long as I stick with the problem and continue to try new ways to solve it until the issues are resolved. It is important to learn new ways to optimize code by looking at other solutions after submitting mine.
